PHP 7 command line [symfony console application][1] to create Apache 2.4 virtual
hosts for Ubuntu.

----------

## Getting Started

This is an Apache adminstrative tool whose commands mostly require sudo.
It can write configuration files to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` invoke `a2ensite`
as well as writing SSL certificates to `/etc/ssl/certs/` and keys to `/etc/ssl/private/`
so the best way to install it would be somewhere in root's path.

[Download the latest release][6], set it executable, and move it to a good path.

    curl -s -L https://github.com/jpuck/avhost/releases/latest | egrep -o '/jpuck/avhost/releases/download/[0-9\.]*/avhost.phar' | wget --base=http://github.com/ -i - -O avhost
    chmod +x avhost
    sudo mv avhost /usr/local/bin/

After installing, run without any arguments to see a list of commands:

    avhost

Use the `-h` flag with any command to get help with usage:

    avhost <command> -h

# Troubleshooting

> Job for apache2.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
> See "systemctl status apache2.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Looking at those logs are certainly helpful, but here are a couple things that might not be obvious
the first time:

## No ssl

To run an encrypted virtual host over [TLS (SSL)][21], you must have enabled [Apache Module mod_ssl][23].

    sudo a2enmod ssl

## No rewrite

The default configuration with `avhost` is to redirect all traffic to an encrypted connection when available.
This is accomplished with [Apache Module mod_rewrite][19].

    sudo a2enmod rewrite

[This is recommended][18] for [many reasons][17].
If necessary, this can be overridden by passing the option `--no-require-ssl`
which makes sense in some cases, like when using a self-signed certificate that might cause trust issues.
However, since you can get a free trusted certificate from [Let's Encrypt][20], then there's no reason to be using
a self-signed certificate on a public site anyway.
